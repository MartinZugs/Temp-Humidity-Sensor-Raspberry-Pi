# Temp-Humidity-Sensor-Raspberry-Pi
This is a program that receives temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor connected to a raspberry pi. This code now sends an email with the current temperature and humidity to whatever email you may choose and from whatever email you want. This code is scheduled to run by using the 'crontab -e' scheduler through the Linux command line on the Raspberry Pi. Big thanks to Alexander Baran-Harper on YouTube for all of the helpful Raspberry Pi tutorials!
