# Temp-Humidity-Sensor-Raspberry-Pi
This is a program that receives temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor connected to a raspberry pi. This program then sends an email with the current temperature and humidity to and from whatever emails you choose. This code is scheduled to run by using the 'crontab -e' scheduler through the Linux command line on the Raspberry Pi. If you wish for this code to work for you, you will need to input your own email and your own credentials. Big thanks to Alexander Baran-Harper on YouTube for all of the helpful Raspberry Pi tutorials!
