# Temp-Humidity-Sensor-Raspberry-Pi
This is a program that receives temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor connected to a raspberry pi. This program then sends an email with the current temperature and humidity to and from whatever emails you choose. This code is scheduled to run by using the 'crontab -e' scheduler through the Linux command line on the Raspberry Pi. Big thanks to Alexander Baran-Harper on YouTube for all of the helpful Raspberry Pi tutorials!
